# Aristotle Labs Challenge
A challenge that will test the true worth and knowledge of those who dare fork this repo.

## Instructions
Create a web app that will test the site speed of a given URL.  The web app should show the user the time to first byte, speed index, and page size for the URL.  Also, it should show the user how they rank for SEO (pass or fail) in terms of if their page title is within the suggested number of characters, the meta description meets best practices, and that there is only one h1 tag on the page.

## Rules
- Use whatever language you need to get the job done.
- The UI should be simple and clear for the user to understand the metrics shown.

- Should be viewable in evergreen browsers.
